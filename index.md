# What do we do?
After many years of development in the shed, we have come up with a metal treatment service that is clean, environmentally friendly and incredibly effective.

So this year we decided to offer it to the public. Derustit is a boutique metal restoration business located in Ballarat, Victoria offering state-wide pickup and delivery services as well as mail-order and courier services to accomodate interstate customers too!

On offer is an electrolytic process that is extremely effective in cleaning and de-rusting of cast iron, steel, and other ferrous metals. To find out more about the process click here...

Our specialty is working with ferrous metals but we also offer cleaning and treatment options for non-ferrous metals, just ask!

Derustit offers a range of solution packages to suit your needs, no job is too small. We can create customised solutions to your project.
