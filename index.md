# What do we do?
After many years of development in the humble backyard shed, we have fine-tuned a metal treatment service that is clean, environmentally friendly and incredibly effective.

So this year we decided to offer it to the public. Derustit is a boutique metal restoration business located in Ballarat, Victoria offering state-wide pickup and delivery services as well as mail-order and courier services to accomodate interstate customers.

At the heart of our operation is an electrolytic metal cleaning process that is extremely effective in cleaning and de-rusting of cast iron, steel, and other ferrous metals. It also strips paint and other coatings. To find out more about the process click here...

Our specialty is working with ferrous metals but we also offer cleaning and treatment options for non-ferrous metals, just ask!

Derustit offers a range of solution packages to suit your needs, no job is too small. We can create a customised solution to suit your project.

# What packages do you offer?

Our packages include:
pre-cleaning (depends on how soiled an object is)
treatment
rust preventative coating/zinc plating/anodising
powder coating/painting
delivery/postage/other fulfilment services

We generally offer 3 tiers of service however we are more than happy to creat a custom solution for you.
