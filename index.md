# What do we do?
After many years of development in the humble backyard shed, we have fine-tuned a metal treatment service that is clean, environmentally friendly and incredibly effective.

So this year we decided to offer it to the public. **Derust It** is a boutique metal restoration business located in Ballarat, Victoria offering state-wide pickup and delivery services as well as mail-order and courier services to accomodate interstate customers.

At the heart of our operation is an electrolytic metal cleaning process that is extremely effective in cleaning and de-rusting of cast iron, steel, and other ferrous metals. It also strips paint and other coatings. To find out more about the process click here...

Our specialty is working with ferrous metals but we also offer cleaning and treatment options for non-ferrous metals, just ask!

**Derust It** offers a range of solution packages to suit your needs, no job is too small. We can create a customised solution to suit your project.

# What packages do we offer?
Package 1:
* Precleaning (
    ** to remove loose contaminants from the object)
* Electrolytic treatment (to deeply clean the metallic object at an atomic level)
* Post-treatment coating (lanolin/paint/powdercoat)

Package 2:
* Package 1 and:
* Zinc plating of parts prior to coating (very effective rust prevention method)

Package 3:
