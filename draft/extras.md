# About
Metal Clean is a boutique metal restoration business located in Ballarat, Victoria. Aimed at small business and the home operator, we strive to provide an excellent restoration service at a fair price. We also offer a mail-order restoration service for customers.

# What do we do?
 We specialise in electrolytic metal cleaning which is a process that is very effective in cleaning metallic surfaces while preserving the underlying metal from further deterioration. 
 Compared to conventional methods of coating and rust removal it is a relatively clean process that produces excellent results. We thrive on bringing an object back to its former glory.  
 This operation is the product of many years of toil and experimentation in the home garage.

# How did it come about?
 Metal Clean was formed out of an ever increasing need for a service that helped out the little guy, the home restorer/hobbyist.

We all have projects we would like to complete but in this modern busy world we have ever decreasing opportunities to work on these projects and actually get them done.

The team at Metal Clean are here to help!

The process was developed with staff trained in metallurgy, materials science, corrosion engineering, and process control. The result is a clean, efficient process for restoration of metallic objects from various states of disrepair to the finish required.  
Oxides, grease, dirt and other contaminants are removed at an atomic level. The underlying metal is not affected, a fresh clean metallic surface remains after processing.

# How does it work?
Surely you are now wondering how it all works? Listed below are the steps involved in restoring an item:
## Inspection
You contact us for an inspection/quote.
 You can send us an email at............ with photos of your parts and a answers to the questions in our assessment guide. Try to explain your goals as best as you can, the more detail we have now, the better we can tailor our service to you and your project. Communication is key, everybody looks for great service from businesses.
Depending on the item you would like treated, our appraiser will come and inspect the item in question. A quote will be given to you and you can book in a time for collection or our appraiser can take it with them to get the process off to a swift start.

## Documentation/Cataloguing  
Your parts are catalogued and labelled/separated.
Computer system - cloud backup
Your parts are tracked throughout the process to mitigate risk of loss/mistake

## Cleaning
Self explanatory, this step involves the removal of loose contaminants to better assess the parts requiring treatment. Pressure washer and degreaser.

## Treating
Electrolytic process where the solid underlying metal is unharmed. Paint and other coatings are softened and removed in a clean process. No hydrocarbons involved, low emissions, water is separated and recycled, making this a truly water-wise process.

## Coating
When treating ferrous metals (cast iron, steel etc), the electrolytic treatment leaves the now freshly exposed metallic surface exposed to the air and rust is quick to form on the exposed surface. A coating is therefore required to stop this from happening.
We offer a number of coating packages:
* ### Lanolin coating 
For cast iron and steel (to manage flash-rusting after the electrolytic process), our most inexpensive option (free!)
* ### Primer
A zinc rich primer that will allow you to leave the parts unpainted for at least a few months.
* ### Primer and Paint
A zinc rich primer and a paint top coat that you specify
* ### Powdercoating
We contract out the powdercoating work to another workshop, we hope to do this process in-house in the future.
* ### Metal Plating
Copper, Zinc, Nickel, Cadmium plating to protect your valuable parts from future corrosion, or just for appearances if you prefer.
* ### Anodising
Hard anodising of aluminum parts as well as aesthetic anodising with a number of colours to choose from.

## Postage/Delivery
Small parts will be posted/delivered back to you using the postage method of your choice:
Registered Post
Express Post
Delivery

Larger parts will need to be returned to you in-person, a member of our team will contact you to arrange a time that best suits you to recieve your parts.

## Survey/Follow-up
You recieve your parts along with a short survey link (or form) to return in the following days. For completing the survey you will recieve a 5%off discount on your next ?order?
The survey helps us to follow up and resolve any issues that have arisen since delivery. You are able to contribute and improve our business practices and if you require our services in the future, you get a sweet 5% off! Can't go wrong with that!

## Satisfaction
You are able to make progress in your project, hopefully getting one step closer to completion and the satisfaction of a job well done!
